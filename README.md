# Import Pan UKBB GSR data into AnVIL from Broad Institute

First, visit the Pan-UK Biobank phenotype manifest [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AeeADtT0U1AukliiNyiVzVRdLYPkTbruQSk38DeutU8/edit#gid=1450719288) to identify a phenotype of interest for your analysis. Enter at least one phenocode from the Google Sheets file (e.g., 30600 is the phenocode corresponding to Albumin) in the JSON template in order to use the PRIMED consortium AnVIL workflow.
